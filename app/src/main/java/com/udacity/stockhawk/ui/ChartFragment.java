     * <p>This function is guaranteed to be called prior to the release of
     * the last data that was supplied for this Loader.  At this point
     * you should remove all use of the old data (since it will be released

     * <p>
     * <ul>
     * <li> <p>The Loader will monitor for changes to the data, and report
     * them to you through new calls here.  You should not monitor the
     * data yourself.  For example, if the data is a {@link Cursor}
     * and you place it in a {@link CursorAdapter}, use
     * the {@link CursorAdapter#CursorAdapter(Context,
     * Cursor, int)} constructor <em>without</em> passing
     * in either {@link CursorAdapter#FLAG_AUTO_REQUERY}
     * or {@link CursorAdapter#FLAG_REGISTER_CONTENT_OBSERVER}
     * (that is, use 0 for the flags argument).  This prevents the CursorAdapter
     * from doing its own observing of the Cursor, which is not needed since
     * when a change happens you will get a new Cursor throw another call
     * here.
     * <li> The Loader will release the data once it knows the application
     * is no longer using it.  For example, if the data is
     * a {@link Cursor} from a {@link CursorLoader},
     * you should not call close() on it yourself.  If the Cursor is being placed in a
     * {@link CursorAdapter}, you should use the
     * {@link CursorAdapter#swapCursor(Cursor)}
     * method so that the old Cursor is not closed.
